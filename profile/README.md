### Calculators

#### Seasonal Candles

A basic calculator for seasonal candles. This also takes into account the Season Pass.

#### Winged Light

A thorough calculator for winged light. This will yield the total amount of winged light one may possess.

Optionally, you may choose to include realms in your command. This will tell you how much winged light you should have after gathering all winged light from a specified realm.

### Hearts
